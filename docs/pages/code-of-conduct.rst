Code of Conduct
===============

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for the people involved with this project. We, as members, contributors
and leaders are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring project that anyone can easily join, expecting
a harassment-free experience, as described in this code of conduct.

This code of conduct is here to ensure we provide a welcoming and inspiring project that anyone can easily join,
expecting a harassment-free experience, as described in this code of conduct.

The goal of this document is to set the overall tone for our community. It is here to outline some of the things you
can and can't do if you wish to participate in our community. However it is not here to serve as a rule-book with
a complete set of things you can't do, social conduct differs from situation to situation, and person to person, but we
should do our best to try and provide a good experience to everyone, in every situation.

We value many things beyond just technical expertise, including collaboration and supporting others within our
community. Providing a positive experience for others can have a much more significant impact than simply providing the
correct answer.

Harassment
----------

We share a common understanding of what constitutes harassment as it applies to a professional setting. Although this
list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin,
political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, disability and personal
appearance. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including some
that may not have been explicitly mentioned here. We consider discrimination of any kind to be unacceptable and
immoral.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Offensive comments (or "jokes") related to any of the above mentioned attributes.
* Deliberate "outing"/"doxing" of any aspect of a person's identity, such as physical or electronic address, without
  their explicit consent, except as necessary to protect others from intentional abuse.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health,
  parenting, drugs and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering. This includes deadnaming or persistently using a pronoun that does not correctly reflect a
  person's gender identity. You must address people by the name they give you when not addressing them by their
  username or handle.
* Threats of violence, both physical and psychological.
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to engage in self-harm.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication.
* Pattern of inappropriate social conduct, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others, or
  excessive teasing after a request to stop.
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Sabotage of someone else's work or intentionally hindering someone else's performance.

Plagiarism
----------

Plagiarism is the re-use of someone else's work (eg: binary content such as images, textual content such as an article,
but also source code, or any other copyrightable resources) without the permission or license right from the author.
Claiming someone else's work as your own is not just immoral and disrespectful to the author, but also illegal in most
countries. You should always follow the authors wishes, and give credit where credit is due.

If we found that you've **intentionally** attempted to add plagiarized content to our code-base, you will likely end up
being permanently banned from any future contributions to this project's repository. We will of course also do our best
to remove, or properly attribute this plagiarized content as quickly as possible.

An unintentional attempt at plagiarism will not be punished as harshly, but nevertheless, it is your responsibility as
a contributor to check where the code you're submitting comes from, and so repeated submission of such content, even
after you were warned might still get you banned.

Please note that an online repository that has no license is presumed to only be source-available, NOT open-source.
Meaning that this work is protected by author's copyright, automatically imposed over it, and without any license
extending that copyright, you have no rights to use such code. So know that you can't simply take some source-code,
even though it's published publicly. This code may be available to be seen by anyone, but that does not mean it's also
available to be used by anyone in other projects.

Another important note to keep in mind is that even if some project has an open-source license, that license may have
conditions which are incompatible with our codebase (such as requiring all of the code that links to this new part to
also be licensed under the same license, which our code-base is not currently under). That is why it's necessary to
understand a license before using code available under it. Simple attribution often isn't everything that the license
requires.

Generally inappropriate behavior
--------------------------------

Outside of just harassment and plagiarism, there are countless other behaviors which we consider unacceptable, as they
may be offensive, and discourage people from engaging with our community.

**Examples of generally inappropriate behavior:**

* The use of sexualized language or imagery of any kind
* The use of inappropriate images, including in an account's avatar
* The use of inappropriate language, including in an account's nickname
* Any spamming, flamming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior
* Discussing topics that are overly polarizing, sensitive, or incite arguments.
* Responding with "RTFM", "just google it" or similar response to help requests
* Other conduct which could be reasonably considered inappropriate

**Examples of generally appropriate behavior:**

* Being kind and courteous to others
* Collaborating with other community members
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including this repository itself, conversations on any
platforms officially connected to this project (such as in GitHub issues, through official emails or applications like
discord). It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of
representing our community include using an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at
an online or offline event.

All members involved with the project are expected to follow this Code of Conduct, no matter their position in the
project's hierarchy, this Code of Conduct applies equally to contributors, maintainers, people seeking help/reporting
bugs, etc.

Enforcement Responsibilities
----------------------------

Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for their actions. If someone has been
harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and to do our best to right the
wrong.

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, harmful, or otherwise undesirable.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
issues and other contributions within the enforcement scope that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will
communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

If you have experienced or witnessed unacceptable behavior constituting a code of conduct violation or have any other
code of conduct concerns, please let us know and we will do our best to resolve this issue.

Reporting a Code of Conduct violation
-------------------------------------

If you saw someone violating the Code of Conduct in some way, you can report it to any repository maintainer, either by
email or through a Discord DM. You should avoid using public channels for reporting these, and instead do so in private
discussion with a maintainer.

Sources
-------

The open-source community has an incredible amount of resources that people have freely provided to others and we all
depend on these projects in many ways. This code of conduct article is no exception and there were many open source
projects that has helped bring this code of conduct to existence. For that reason, we'd like to thank all of these
communities and projects for keeping their content open and available to everyone, but most notably we'd like to thank
the projects with established codes of conduct and diversity statements that we used as our inspiration. Below is the
list these projects:

* `Python <https://www.python.org/community/diversity/>`_
* `Contributor Covenant <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/>`_
* `Rust-lang <https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct>`_
