## What is Mcproto

Mcproto is a python library that provides various low level interactions with the Minecraft protocol. It attempts to be
a full wrapper around the Minecraft protocol, which means it could be used as a basis for Minecraft bots written in
python, or even full python server implementations.

!!! warning

    This library is still heavily Work-In-Progress, which means a lot of things can still change and some features may
    be missing or incomplete. Using the library for production applications at it's current state isn't recommended.
