# Changelog

!!! danger ""

    Major and minor releases also include the changes specified in prior development releases.

!!! bug "Missing unreleased changes"

    This changelog doesn't contain any unreleased (pending) changes, even if they are present in this version of the
    project documentation already. If you are interested in knowing what these changes are, you can take a look at the
    [`changes/`](https://github.com/py-mine/mcproto/tree/main/changes) directory of the project.

    In the future, we want to display these changes properly in this documentation, however, doing so requires running
    a command dynamically, and showing it's output here, which we currently don't support.

    <!-- TODO: Find a way to fix this. -->
