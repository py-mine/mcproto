Minecraft account authentication
================================

Mcproto has first party support to handle authentication, allowing you to use your own minecraft account. This is
needed if you wish to login to "online mode" (non-warez) servers as a client (player).

Microsoft (migrated) accounts
-----------------------------

This is how authentication works for already migrated minecraft accounts, using Microsoft accounts for authentication.
(This will be most accounts. Any newly created minecraft accounts - after 2021 will always be Microsoft linked accounts.)

Creating Azure application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To authenticate with a microsoft account, you will need to go through the entire OAuth2 flow. Mcproto has functions to
hide pretty much all of this away, however you will need to create a new Microsoft Azure application, that mcproto will
use to obtain an access token.

We know this is annoying, but it's a necessary step, as Microsoft only allows these applications to request OAuth2
authentication, and to avoid potential abuse, we can't really just use our registered application (like with say
`MultiMC <https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher>`_), as this token would have to be embedded into our source-code, and
since this is python, that would mean just including it here in plain text, and because mcproto is a low level library
that can be used for any kind of interactions, we can't trust that you won't abuse this token.

Instead, everyone using mcproto should register a new application, and get their own MSA token for your application
that uses mcproto in the back.

To create a new application, follow these steps (this is a simplified guide, for a full guide, feel free to check the
`Microsoft documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app>`):

#. Go to the `Azure portal <https://portal.azure.com/#home>`_ and log in (create an account if you need to).
#. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.
#. On the left navbar, under **Manage** section, click on **App registrations**.
#. Click on **New registration** on top navbar.
#. Pick a name for the application. Anyone using your app to authenticate will see this name.
#. Choose **Personal Microsoft accounts only** from the Supported account types.
#. Leave the **Redirect URI (optional)** empty.
#. Click on **Register**.

From there, you will need to enable this application to be used for OAuth2 flows. To do that, follow these steps:

#. On the left navbar, under **Manage** section, click on **Authentication**.
#. Set **Allow public content flows** to **Yes**.
#. Click **Save**.

After that, you can go back to the app (click **Overview** from the left navbar), and you'll want to copy the
**Application (client) ID**. This is the ID you will need to pass to mcproto. (You will also need the **Display name**,
and the **Directory (Tenant) ID** for `Registering the application with Minecraft`_ - first time only)

If you ever need to access this application again, follow these steps (as Microsoft Azure is pretty unintuitive, we
document this too):

#. Go to the `Azure portal <https://portal.azure.com/#home>`_ and log in.
#. Click on **Azure Active Directory** (if you can't find it on the main page, you can use the search).
#. On the left navbar, under **Manage** section, click on **App registrations**.
#. Click on **View all applications from personal account** (assuming you registered the app from a personal account).
#. Click on your app.

Registering the application with Minecraft
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Previously, this step wasn't required, however due to people maliciously creating these applications to steal accounts,
Mojang have recently started to limit access to the ``https://api.minecraftservices.com``, and only allow explicitly
white listed Client IDs to use this API.

This API is absolutely crucial step in getting the final minecraft token, and so you will need to register your Client
ID to be white listed by Mojang. Thankfully, it looks like Mojang is generally pretty lenient and at least for me, they
didn't cause any unnecessary hassles when I asked for my application to be registered, for development purposes and
work on mcproto.

That said, you will need to wait a while (about a week, though it could be more), until Mojang reviews your application
and approves it. There isn't much we can do about this.

To get your Azure application registered, you will need to fill out a simple form, where you accept the EULA, provide
your E-Mail, Application name, Application Client ID and Tennant ID.

More annoyingly you will additionally also need to provide an **associated website or domain** for your project/brand.
(This application is generally designed for more user-facing programs, such as full launchers. When registering
mcproto, I just used the GitHub URL). Lastly, you'll want to describe why you need access to this API in the
**Justification** section.

Visit the `mojang article <https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/16254801392141>`_ describing this process.
There is also a link to the form to fill out.


The code
^^^^^^^^

Finally, after you've managed to register your application and get it approved by Mojang, you can use it with mcproto,
go through the Microsoft OAuth2 flow and authorize this application to access your Microsoft account, which mcproto
will then use to get the minecraft token you'll then need to login to online servers.

.. code-block:: python

  import httpx
  from mcproto.auth.microsoft.oauth import full_microsoft_oauth
  from mcproto.auth.microsoft.xbox import xbox_auth
  from mcproto.auth.msa import MSAAccount

  MY_MSA_CLIENT_ID = "[REDACTED]"  # Paste your own Client ID here

  async def authenticate() -> MSAAccount:
      async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
          microsoft_token = await full_microsoft_oauth(client, MY_MSA_CLIENT_ID)
          user_hash, xsts_token = xbox_auth(client, microsoft_token)
          return MSAAccount.xbox_auth(cilent, user_hash, xsts_token)

Note that the :meth:`~mcproto.auth.microsoft.oauth.full_microsoft_oauth` will print a message containing the URL you
should visit in your browser, and a one time code to type in once you reach this URL. That will then prompt you to log
in to your Microsoft account, and then allow you to authorize the application to use your account.

You will very likely want to set up caching here, and store at least the ``microsoft_token`` somewhere, so you don't
have to log in each time your code will run. Here's some example code that caches every step of the way, always
resorting to the "closest" functional token. Note that this is using `pickle` to store the tokens, you may want to use
JSON or other format instead, as it would be safer. Also, be aware that these are sensitive and if compromised, someone
could gain access to your minecraft account (though only for playing, they shouldn't be able to change your password or
anything like that), so you might want to consider encrypting these cache files before storing:

.. code-block:: python

  from __future__ import annotations

  import logging
  import pickle
  from pathlib import Path

  import httpx

  from mcproto.auth.microsoft.oauth import full_microsoft_oauth
  from mcproto.auth.microsoft.xbox import XSTSRequestError, xbox_auth
  from mcproto.auth.msa import MSAAccount, ServicesAPIError

  log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

  MY_MSA_CLIENT_ID = "[REDACTED]"  # Paste your own Client ID here
  CACHE_DIR = Path(".cache/")


  async def microsoft_login(client: httpx.AsyncClient) -> MSAAccount:  # noqa: PLR0912,PLR0915
      """Obtain minecraft account using Microsoft authentication.

      This function performs full caching of every step along the way, allowing for recovery
      without manual intervention for as long as at least the root token (from Microsoft OAuth2)
      is valid. Any later tokens will be refreshed and re-cached once invalid.

      If all tokens are invalid, or this function was ran for the first time (without any cached
      data), you will be shown a URL and a code. You have to go to this URL with your browser and
      enter the code, completing the OAuth2 flow, obtaining the root token.

Minecraft (non-migrated) accounts
---------------------------------

If you still haven't migrated your account and linked it to a Microsoft account, follow this guide for authentication.
(Any newly created Minecraft accounts will be using Microsoft accounts already.) This method of authentication is
called "yggdrasil".

.. warning::
   Mojang has announced that they will be closing the migration period for these unmigrated accounts in **September
   19, 2023**. See: `<https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/account-migration-last-call>`_

   Once that happen, any unmigrated accounts will no longer work, and you won't be able to log in. If you're still
   using an unmigrated account, it's about time to move.

   Mcproto will remove support for this old authentication methods once this happens.

This method of authentication doesn't require any special app registrations, however it is significantly less secure,
as you need to enter your login and password directly.

.. code-block:: python

  import httpx
  from mcproto.auth.yggdrasil import YggdrasilAccount

  LOGIN = "mail@example.com"
  PASSWORD = "my_password"

  async def authenticate() -> YggdrasilAccount:
      async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
          return YggdrasilAccount.authenticate(client, login=LOGIN, password=PASSWORD)


The Account instance you will obtain here will contain a refresh token, and a shorter lived access token, received from
Mojang APIs from the credentials you entered. Just like with Microsoft accounts, you may want to cache these tokens to
avoid needless calls to request new ones and go through authentication again. That said, since doing so doesn't
necessarily require user interaction, if you make the credentials accessible from your code directly, this is a lot
less annoying.

If you will decide to use caching, or if you plan on using these credentials in a long running program, you may see the
access token expire. You can check whether the token is expired with the
:meth:`~mcproto.auth.yggdrasil.YggdrasilAccount.validate` method, and if it is (call returned ``False``), you can call
:meth:`~mcproto.auth.yggdrasil.YggdrasilAccount.refresh` to use the refresh token to obtain a new access token. The
refresh token is much more long lived than the access token, so this should generally be enough for you, although if
you login from elsewhere, or after a really long time, the refresh token might be invalidated, in that case, you'll
need to go through the full login again.

Legacy Mojang accounts
----------------------

If your minecraft account is still using the (really old) Mojang authentication, you can simply follow the non-migrated
guide, as it will work with these legacy accounts too, the only change you will need to make is to use your username,
instead of an email.
