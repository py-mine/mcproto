# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**We urge you not to file a bug report in the GitHub issue tracker, since they are open for anyone to see**

Instead, we encourage you to reach out to the maintainer team so we can assess the problem and later disclose it
responsibly.

To do so, you can use the `Security` tab and file a bug report there

Alternatively, you can also reach out to the maintainer team directly. If you prefer this approach, you can contact one
of the people below:

- **ItsDrike** (project maintainer and owner)
    - **Email:** `itsdrike@protonmail.com`
    - **Discord:** `ItsDrike#5359` (however you will need to join the [py-mine discord](https://discord.gg/C2wX7zduxC) too,
      as I might not answer to message requests from people I don't share a server with.)
