`LoginEncryptionRequest` now uses `cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa.RSAPublicKey` to hold the public key, instead of just pure `bytes`. Encoding and decoding of this key happens automatically during serialize/deserialize. This is a breaking change for anyone relying on the `public_key` field from this packet being `bytes`, and for anyone initializing this packet directly with `__init__`, which now expects `RSAPublicKey` instance instead.
