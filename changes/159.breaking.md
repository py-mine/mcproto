Fix packet compression handling in the interaction methods.

This fixes a bug that didn't allow for specifying an exact compression threshold that the server specified in `LoginSetCompression` packet, and instead only allowing to toggle between compression on/off, which doesn't really work as server doesn't expect compression for packets below that threshold.

- `sync_write_packet`, `async_write_pakcet`, `sync_read_packet` and `async_read_packet` functions now take `compression_threshold` instead of `compressed` bool flag
