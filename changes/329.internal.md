- Change the type-checker from `pyright` to `basedpyright`
  - BasedPyright is a fork of pyright, which provides some additional typing features and re-implements various proprietary features from the closed-source Pylance vscode extension.
  - Overall, it is very similar to pyright with some bonus stuff on top. However, it does mean all contributors who want proper editor support for the project will need to update their editor settings and add basedpyright. The instructions on how to do this are described in the updated `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
