Restructure the project, moving to a single protocol version model
- This change does NOT have a deprecation period, and will very likely break most existing code-bases. However this change is necessary, as multi-version support was unsustainable (see issue #45 for more details)
- Any packets and types will no longer be present in versioned folders (mcproto.packets.v757.xxx), but rather be directly in the parent directory (mcproto.packets.xxx).
- This change doesn't affect manual communication with the server, connection, and basic IO writers/readers remain the same.
