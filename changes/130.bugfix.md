`LoginEncryptionResponse` now includes the `server_id` field. This field was previously hard-coded to 20 spaces (blank value), which is what all minecraft clients on minecraft 1.7.x or higher do, however with older versions, this field is set to 20 random characters, which we should respect.
- This is not a breaking change, as `server_id` will default to `None` in `LoginEncryptionResponse`'s `__init__`, meaning any existing code utilizing this packet will still work. It is purely an additional option.
