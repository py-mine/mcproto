Preserve the call parameters and overloads in the typing signature of `mcproto.packets.packet_map.generate_packet_map` function. (This wasn't the case before, since `functools.lru_cache` doesn't preserve this data). Note that this loses on the typing information about the cache itself, as now it will appear to be a regular uncached function to the type-checker. We deemed this approach better to the alternative of no typing info for call arguments or overloads, but preserving cache info.
