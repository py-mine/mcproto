- Fix CI not running unit tests on python 3.8 (only 3.11)
- Update to use python 3.12 (in validation and as one of the matrix versions in unit-tests workflow)
- Trigger and run lint and unit-tests workflows form a single main CI workflow.
- Only send status embed after the main CI workflow finishes (not for both unit-tests and validation)
