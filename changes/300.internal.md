Update CI

    - Fix CI not running unit tests on python 3.8 (only 3.11)
    - Update to use python 3.12 (in validation and as one of the matrix versions in unit-tests workflow)
    - Trigger and run lint and unit-tests workflows form a single main CI workflow.
    - Only send status embed after the main CI workflow finishes (not for both unit-tests and validation)
    - Use `--output-format=github` for `ruff check` in the validation workflow
    - Fix the status-embed workflow
