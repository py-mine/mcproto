The `LoginStart` packet now contains a (required) UUID field (which can be explicitly set to `None`).
- For some reason, this field was not added when the login packets were introduced initially, and while the UUID field can indeed be omitted in some cases (it is an optional filed), in vast majority of cases, it will be present, and we should absolutely support it.
- As this is a new required field, the `__init__` function of `LoginStart` now also expects this `uuid` keyword argument to be present, making this a breaking change.
