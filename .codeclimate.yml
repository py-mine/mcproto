checks:
  # As a library that handles networking and packets at a relatively low level, the usual
  # code complexity requirements are pretty hard to fulfill.
  #
  # The cognitive complexity of many of functions handling lower level network
  # interactions can be quite high, and even some relatively short functions can end up
  # being marked as too complex, due to the logic they contain (such as bit manipulation)
  # Splitting these functions up would often actually end up decreasing the internal code
  # readability, and also a drop in performance due to function call overhead.
  #
  # For that reason, many of the checks are either disabled or have their threshold set
  # quite high.
