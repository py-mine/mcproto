Mcproto is a python library that provides various low level interactions with the Minecraft protocol. It attempts to be
a full wrapper around the Minecraft protocol, which means it could be used as a basis for Minecraft bots written in
python, or even full python server implementations.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, the library is still work in progress and very incomplete, so while contributions are welcome, fair warning
> that using mcproto in production isn't recommended.

For more info, check our [documentation](https://py-mine.github.io/mcproto).
