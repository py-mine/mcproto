    Child classes of this mixin will have their lookup logic changed, to instead perform a lookup
    on the wrapped attribute. Only if that lookup fails, we fallback to this class, meaning if both
    the wrapped attribute and this class have some attribute defined, the attribute from the wrapped
    object is returned. The only exceptions to this are lookup of the ``_WRAPPED_ATTRIBUTE`` variable,
    and of the attribute name stored under the ``_WRAPPED_ATTRIBUTE`` (the wrapped object).

    If the attribute held by the wrapped object is an asynchronous function, instead of returning it
    directly, the :func:`.synchronize` function will be called, returning a wrapped synchronous
    alternative for the requested async function.

    By default, mock objects propagate themselves by returning a new instance of the same mock
    class, with same initialization attributes. THis is done whenever we're accessing new
    attributes that mock class.

    This propagation makes sense for simple mocks without any additional restrictions, however when
    dealing with limited mocks to some ``spec_set``, it doesn't usually make sense to propagate
    those same ``spec_set`` restrictions, since we generally don't have attributes/methods of a
    class be of/return the same class.

    This mixin class stops this propagation, and instead returns instances of specified mock class,
    defined in :attr:`.child_mock_type` class variable, which is by default set to
    :class:`~unittest.mock.MagicMock`, as it can safely represent most objects.

    .. note:
        This propagation handling will only be done for the mock classes that inherited from this
        mixin class. That means if the :attr:`.child_mock_type` is one of the regular mock classes,
        and the mock is propagated, a regular mock class is returned as that new attribute. This
        regular class then won't have the same overrides, and will therefore propagate itself, like
        any other mock class would.

        If you wish to counteract this, you can set the :attr:`.child_mock_type` to a mock class
        that also inherits from this mixin class, perhaps to your class itself, overriding any
        propagation recursively.
