    """Mixin class to ABCs that require certain attributes to be set in order to allow initialization.

    This class performs a similar check to what :class:`~abc.ABC` already does with abstractmethods,
    but for class variables. The required class variable names are set with :attr:`._REQUIRED_CLASS_VARS`
    class variable, which itself is automatically required.

    Just like with ABCs, this doesn't prevent creation of classes without these required class vars
    defined, only initialization is prevented. This is done to allow creation of a more specific, but
    still abstract class.

    Additionally, you can also define :attr:`._REQUIRED_CLASS_VARS_NO_MRO` class var, holding names of
    class vars which should be defined on given class directly. That means inheritance will be ignored
    so even if a subclass defines the required class var, unless the latest class also defines it, this
    check will fail.

    This is often useful for classes that are expected to be slotted, as each subclass will need to define
    ``__slots__``, otherwise a ``__dict__`` will automatically be made for it. However this is entirely
    optional, and if :attr:`._REQUIRED_CLASS_VARS_NO_MRO` isn't set, this check is skipped.
